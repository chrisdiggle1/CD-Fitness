          This goes without saying, but a gym membership can definitely lead to
          an increase in your fitness level. Whether you’re a senior trying to
          stay active or an athlete looking to increase your performance level,
          being in the gym on a regular basis is going to help. Having a
          membership with CD-Fitness will almost certainly lead you to set up a
          regular exercise schedule and stick to it.

        <h2>Boost Energy <i class="fa-solid fa-person-running"></i></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Regular exercise boosts energy levels. Exercise releases endorphins,
          which are hormones that make you feel good. Extra endorphins and an
          increase in energy levels will also pay off by helping your mental
          health too. The exercise “high” you get will carry over into the rest
          of your day, making your mood better overall

        <h2>Stress relief <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Getting regular exercise is a great way to relieve stress and improve
          your mental health. Exercise reduces stress by producing endorphins, a
          neurotransmitter that makes you feel good and can improve your mood.
          It can also help reverse the negative effects of stress and just help
          you forget the day’s worries.

        <h2>Improve Sleep <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Studies show that regular exercise can help you fall asleep faster,
          fight insomnia, and help you get deep, restorative sleep. If you’re
          someone who needs better sleep, exercise can be a way to help achieve
          it. Make sure you’re getting regular physical activity and better
          sleep will follow.
