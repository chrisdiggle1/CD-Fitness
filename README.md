## CD-FITNESS

This website has been built for my first portfolio project. The website is a static website using HTML and CSS. 

For this project I have decided to build a website based on a ficticious gym as fitness is somthing I value.

The site is aimed to attract customers, with a nice easy to read layout, complimenting colour scheme, and providing all the information a potential new customer would need to make the decision to sign up.

# Balsamiq Wireframes

The website has 4 pages and was designed using Balsamiq Wireframes.

1. **Home Page** 

**First-time User**

As a first time user, I want to ...

1. Easily be able to navigate through the site.

3. Find out how to contact the gym for more information.
4. See what classes are on and what times.
5. Locate socail media links to see followings and cooments/reviews.

2. View the social media links to connect with the gym and other members.
3. See if there are any offers for existing members.
4. Find directions to the gym.
5. View updates to any of the amenities.

**Site Owner**

As the site owner, I want the users to ...

1. To navigate easily through the site.
2. Learn what services are on offer, what classes are available and memebership options we have.
3. Feel comforatable reaching out to the gym for further information or to report any issues.


## Target Audience 

I have designed this website with the intention to target everyone, from all walks of life. I 
want to attract newcomers who have never been to a gym before, aswell as regulars to a gym who
would like to try out a new gymm. I want the website to be specific in what amenities and classes
we have on offer. The amenities page has a clear visualisation of what we have in the gym and the 
classes page to clearly state what classes we currently run.
