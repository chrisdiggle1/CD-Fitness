# **CD-FITNESS**

This website has been built for my first portfolio project. The website is a static website using HTML and CSS. 

For this project I have decided to build a website based on a ficticious gym as fitness is somthing I value.

The site is aimed to attract customers, with a nice easy to read layout, complimenting colour scheme, and providing all the information a potential new customer would need to make the decision to sign up.

## **Live Site**



## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Website Structure**

##### Balsamiq Wireframes

The website has 6 pages. 4 pages are accessible with links in the header,
and there is also a thank you page you are dirceted to when you fill in the form and hit the 'lets go' button, and a 404 error page if the URL is incorrectly input.

3. Find out how to contact the gym for more information.
4. See what classes are on and what times.

2. View the social media links to connect with the gym and other members.
3. See if there are any offers for existing members.
4. Find directions to the gym.

## **Target Audience** 

I have designed this website with the intention to target everyone, from all walks of life. I 
want to attract newcomers who have never been to a gym before, aswell as regulars to a gym who
would like to try out a new gymm. I want the website to be specific in what amenities and classes
we have on offer. The amenities page has a clear visualisation of what we have in the gym and the 
classes page to clearly state what classes we currently run.  

## **Page Features**

### **Header**

* The header is featured on all pages on the webiste.

* The header contains the brand name and logo and links to the Home page, Amenities page, classes page and sign up page. 

* Each link in the header is underlined when the user hovers over it. 

### **Footer**

* The footer is featured on all pages on the website with the exception of the 404 page.

* The footer has links to the most commonly used social media sites which CD-Fitness members use.

* Each link opens the page in a new tab when selected.

### **Home Page**

* Contains an image of a male and female working out in the gym. this is to grab the users attention when the page first laods.

* The image also has some text overlay with an opaque background to stand out on the page.

* Cantains four reasons why the user should join us, with a decription of each of the benefits. 

* Displays the meberships and costs that are on offer.

### **Amenities Page**
