# **CD-FITNESS**

This website has been built for my first portfolio project and is for educational purposes only. The website is a static website using HTML and CSS. 

For this project I have decided to build a website based on a ficticious gym as fitness is somthing I value. The name CD - Fitness has been used simply from using my own initials.

The site is aimed to attract customers, with a nice easy to read layout, complimenting colour scheme, and providing all the information a potential new customer would need to make the decision to sign up.

## **User Experience (UX)**


### **First-time User**

As a first time user, I want to ...

1. Easily be able to navigate through the site.
2. Understand clearly what memberships the gym has to offer.
3. Find out how to contact the gym for more information.
4. See what classes are on and what times.
5. Locate socail media links to see followings and cooments/reviews.

### **Returning User**

As a returning user, I want to...

1. See if any new clases have been added or times have changed.
2. View the social media links to connect with the gym and other members.
3. See if there are any offers for existing members.
4. Find directions to the gym.
5. View updates to any of the amenities.

### **Site Owner**

As the site owner, I want the users to ...

1. To navigate easily through the site.
2. Learn what services are on offer, what classes are available and memebership options we have.
3. Feel comforatable reaching out to the gym for further information or to report any issues.


## **Target Audience** 

I have designed this website with the intention to target everyone, from all walks of life. I 
want to attract newcomers who have never been to a gym before, aswell as regulars to a gym who
would like to try out a new gymm. I want the website to be specific in what amenities and classes
we have on offer. The amenities page has a clear visualisation of what we have in the gym and the 
classes page to clearly state what classes we currently run.  


## **Design**

### **Website Structure**

##### Balsamiq Wireframes

The website has 6 pages. 4 pages are accessible by selecting a link in the header,
and there is also a thank you page you are dirceted to when you fill in the sign up form and hit the 'lets go' button, and a 404 error page if the URL is incorrectly input.

</details>

### **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme of the website was decided by asking my children to pick a colour for my background. They both decided they wanted Sky Blue, so from that I picked Bistre for the headings to stand out against the blue background. Light Coral has been used with an opaque effect on the home page, join us and thank you pages.

![alt palette of the colours used in the site](documentation/color-scheme.PNG)

### **Typography**

I chose to use the Play font. I beleive this font has a sporty look about it and fits well with the theme of the site.
The Play font is a sans serif font which is great for accessibility and dyslexic users.

I used google fonts to import the fonts for this project.

* All pages on the site have a Favicon. The Favicon contains the letters CDF and uses the colour theme from the main site, with a Sky Blue background and the letters in Bistre.

## **Accessibility**

I have tried to ensure the website is accessible friendly as possible. I have tried to achive this by:

* Using Semantic HTML
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### **Lighthouse Tests**

The Lighthouse tool on Google DevTools was used to test the accessibility and performance of the 4 main pages of the site. The pages were tested for mobile and desktop and recieved high scores in all the required areas.

<summary>Signup Page</summary>

</details>

<br>

### **WAVE**

Each page was run through the Web Accessibility Evalulation Tool (WAVE).

The alerts on the pages are due to the text on the footer not being listed as a header and is a paragraph instead with bigger font-size. This was changed after coming up with a warning the first time I ran the page through the HTML validator.

The error on the thankyou page is because I have set the page to automatically re-direct the user back to the homepage after 10 seconds of displaying the page
