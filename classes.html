          <hr>
          <p>
            High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a training protocol
            alternating short periods of intense or explosive anaerobic exercise
            with brief recovery periods until the point of exhaustion. HIIT
            involves exercises performed in repeated quick bursts at maximum or
            near maximal effort with periods of rest or low activity between
            bouts.

          <h2>Spin</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            A spin class consists of a group of people in a studio with a spin
            bike each, following directions from an instructor. A spin bike has
            a flywheel directly connected to the cranks which means you need to
            use your leg muscles to not only speed it up but to slow it down
            too. The handlebars and seat are adjustable to ensure your bike fits
            and you get the feeling of riding a real bike.
